# Hi, I’m Adhi 👋  

Physicist wandering through quantum systems — from non-Hermitian quirks to transport and computation.  
I like when math starts talking back through code.  

## 🛠️ What you’ll find here
- Quantum models that misbehave (HN, SSH, and more to come)  
- Spectra that look like abstract paintings but are actually physics  
- Code that pretends to be tidy (until you read the comments)  

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- I break symmetries for fun (don’t worry, only in Hamiltonians).  
- If something runs without an error on first try, I assume the physics is wrong.  

✨ *This is my little sandbox: physics, code, and a bit of chaos disguised as research.*
