# Hi, I'm Adhi 👋  

Physicist learning to see the world through code.  
From non-Hermitian lattices to ODEs to Monte Carlo — if it involves numerical methods and physics, I'm probably breaking it.  

## 🛠️ What you'll find here

**Currently available:**
- Numerical methods for ODEs (4th order Runge-Kutta implementation)
- Non-Hermitian skin effect simulations (PBC spectra, OBC localization, winding numbers)

**In the works:**
- More lattice models and topological systems
- Monte Carlo methods for statistical physics

## ⚡ Current vibe

Building my computational physics toolkit in public. Some repos are polished, others are "it compiled once so I'm committing it." All of it is part of figuring out how math actually behaves when you force it through NumPy.
